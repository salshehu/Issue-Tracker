            Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web
            applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and
            Next.js for additional features and optimizations. Under the hood,
            Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed
            for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to
            focus on building your application instead of spending time with
            configuration. Whether you&apos;re an individual developer or part
            of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic,
            and fast React applications.

          TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types. What is
          TypeScript? TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which
          adds static typing. It is a free and open-source high-level
          programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing
          with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the
          development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. <hr />
          TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter
          integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.
